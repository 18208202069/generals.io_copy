# generalsio_copy
An imitation of custom-room mode of generals.io, written in python with flask_socketio.

This imitation only guarantees that the rule is the same as the original ones, but not the APIs.

## Running
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

Then just open `http://localhost:23333'.
